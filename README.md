## About me:

I am a fourth year undergraduate student at Rochester Institute of Technology majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Applied Statistics. Some areas of my major which really interest me besides programming are Data Science, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning among others. I am proficient in coding Python and Java, and multiple other languages, while doing projects related to the former languages. In addition, I am also taking courses to further my knowledge in Data Science, an area of interest to me.
